# COMP-2005-Term-Project

While programming the project I used tkcalender for a better user
interface but using tkcalender lead me to some logic-oriented
problems. Tkcalender date range predefined functions generate
datetime.date objects for saving and using that data to demonstrate
occupied dates. My first approach was to convert the datetime.date
objects into integer timestamp values but it didnâ€™t go well as I
expected. I ended up converting datetime objects into string list
objects in order to filter and display the values to the user in a more
readable approach. I Tried my best to implement a MVC structure for
this project but my lack of experience with the MVC structure
alongside with my lack of knowledge on python prevented me from
doing so. I made the application as CSV write-read and I am unable to
convert to python pickle and I did not want it to copy paste code from
AI applications.
